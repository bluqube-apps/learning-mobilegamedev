# Bluqube Learningâ„¢ | Mobile Game Programming
> Module Design/Outline

### Description
This module provides students with an in-depth introduction to technologies and best practices used in game programming today and is focused on developing mobile games using open-source solutions and public assets.


**Topics**
>Topics will be demonstrated through live-code examples/slides, videos and demos.

* Phases of Game Development
* Mobile Game Development History
* Types of Mobile Games
* Programming
  * Game Engines
  * User Interface
  * Objects, interactions, simulations
  * Events such as triggers, time and collisions



#### Learning Guides
Bluqube Tech Team

#### Prerequisites

> These won't be enforced by the instructors, but you will be pretty lost without understanding those concepts.

* Basic knowledge on object-oriented programming.
* Basic knowledge of using 2D and 3D multimedia applications (Photoshop, 3DS Max, C4D...etc).
* Basic understanding of 3D graphics (Modeling, Texturing, Rendering, Animation... etc.).

#### Module Matrix
> This is a very flexible module and this material is subject to change depending on the available resources and schedule.
